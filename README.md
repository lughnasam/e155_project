# Luna and Kanoa E155 Final Project

This repository contains FPGA and MCU code to read the inputs from guitar pedals as well as samples from an ADC that is connected to an electric guitar. Effects that are activated are applied to the signal using the FPGA or MCU, then the signal will be output through the MCU's onboard DAC to play the modified guitar sound.

The code, radiant project, and Questa sim files can be found in the FPGA folder. All MCU code and the accompanying Segger project can be found in the MCU folder. Datasheets used are found in the datasheets folder. Any testing evidence can be seen in the Testbench folder.
